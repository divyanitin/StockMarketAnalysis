Analysis of Stocks using Machine learning Models

Addressing the task of building a stock trading system based
on prediction models obtained with daily stock quotes data. 

Several models are tried with the goal of predicting the future returns of the S&P 500
market index. These predictions are used together with a trading strategy
to reach a decision regarding the market orders to generate. 

Addressing several new data mining issues, among which are 
(1) how to use R to analyze data stored in a database
(2) how to handle prediction problems with a time ordering among data observations (also known as time series), and 
(3) an example of the difficulties of translating model predictions into decisions and actions in real-world applications.

In methodological terms, few topics introduced are:
• Time series modeling
• Handling regime shifts with windowing mechanisms
• Artificial neural networks
• Support vector machines
• Multivariate adaptive regression splines
• Evaluating time series models with the Monte Carlo method
• Several new evaluation statistics related either to the prediction of rare
events or with financial trading performance

From the perspective of learning R
• How to handle time series data
• How to read data from di↵erent sources, such as data bases
• How to obtain several new types of models (SVMs, ANNs, and MARS)
• How to use several packages specifically dedicated to financial modeling

Attached is the case study that was referred in successfully starting and completing this project.
